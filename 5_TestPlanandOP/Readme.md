## Train the Data 

We had trained the data using some basic Machine learning Algorithms like Logistics Regressiong , Naive bias .
1 . Logistic Regression 
After training my data with logistic regression when i got the following ROC-AUC Graph

## Conclusion

So Logistic Regression will give more Accuraccy than Naive Bias
